#🚗 Car Price Prediction using Machine Learning

This project uses machine learning algorithms to predict the selling price of a car based on various features like year,Km_driven, fuel type, transmission, etc. It aims to help sellers and buyers understand the fair price of used cars.

##🔍 Problem Statement

Accurately predicting the price of used cars is crucial for both buyers and sellers in the automobile market. This project builds a regression model that learns patterns from a historical dataset and provides price estimates for unseen data.
