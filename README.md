# Car Price Prediction using Machine Learning

This project uses machine learning algorithms to predict the selling price of a car based on various features like year,Km_driven, fuel type, transmission, etc. It aims to help sellers and buyers understand the fair price of used cars.

## Problem Statement

Accurately predicting the price of used cars is crucial for both buyers and sellers in the automobile market. This project builds a regression model that learns patterns from a historical dataset and provides price estimates for unseen data.

## Project Overview

**Problem Statement** : Predict the selling price of a car based on car features.

**Dataset**           : Data set Collected from kaggle.Contains attributes like Name,Year,Km_driven,fuel_type,seller_type,Transmission,Owner,Mileage,Engine,Max_power,Seats.

**Model Used**        : Random Forest

**Tools**             : Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Jupyter Notebook ,Visual Studio Code.
