**#ðŸš— Car Price Prediction**
##This project uses machine learning techniques to predict the price of a car based on various features such as Name ,Year,Km_driven,fuel_type,seller_type,Transmission,Owner,Mileage,Engine,Max_power,Seats. The goal is to build a regression model that can accurately estimate car prices to assist buyers, sellers, or dealerships.
